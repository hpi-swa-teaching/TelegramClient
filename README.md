## Overview
TeleSqueak is a **Squeak-Client** for the widely used Telegram-Messenger. It aims to provide features such as Authentication, Contacts, Message and Media sending and a minimal, clean UI as well as as a Zen-mode and receiving messages in the background.

*This Project is part of the "Softwaretechnik" Lecture 2020 at the Hasso Plattner Institute.*

## Installation
Make sure you have the current version of Squeak installed.
* Step 1: Install the Squeak Git Client and clone this repository. For the trunk clone develop, for the latest stable release choose master.
* Step 2: Install the Squeak FFI Workload. To do so, open the Workspace in Squeak and execute the following command:   `(Installer repository: 'http://source.squeak.org/FFI')
install: 'FFI-Pools';
install: 'FFI-Kernel'.`
* Step 3: Download the required native Binaries for your system. [Windows](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/tdlib/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Windows+CI%22), [Mac](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/tdlib/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Tdlib+Max+x64+Build%22), [Ubuntu 18 lts](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/tdlib/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Tdlib+Ubuntu+Build%22). Select the latest successful run of the pipeline and download the single artifact produced by the respective pipeline.
* Step 4: Place the unzipped binaries inside of your squeak image inside the 'Resource' folder.
* Step 5 (Windows only): Install the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

Alternatively, check our [release page](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/TelegramClient/releases) for an online installer in the form of a sar file. In that case you just have to follow steps two and five.
## Running TelegramClient
In a workspace window either execute the command `TCUTelegram newWithTCCCore` or click the Telegram entry in the Apps dropdown menu. The menu is only available if you already started the app once or installed the app via a release sar file.

## Building Tdlib
Tdlib build instructions are available on their Github page. They also have a wonderful build instruction generator available which was the basis for our workflow . [Check it out here.](https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html) Alternatively use the [Github Pipelines](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/tdlib) we setup and modify them according to newer build instructions for successive tdlib versions. Currently we release at Tag 1.6.0.

## Notes on Tdlib
The TelegramClient is build on the TelegramDatabseLibrary which provides access to Telegram API via a JSON-Interface.
We include Tdlib in our project and can access it with the Squeak FFI, in turn allowing us to access the Telegram API via JSON-Interface.
Once this project concludes there will be a need for the next group to aquire a new [API key](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id).

## Resources for following groups
We have developed a [Project-Guide](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/TelegramClient/wiki) which contains the most important information to continue developing the TelegramClient. Feel free to add new information to the wiki.

## Our Group
